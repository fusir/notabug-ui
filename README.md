This is a UI client for notabug built in React based on Reddit's open-source classic UI.

**notabug** is a p2p link aggregator app that is:

- distributed: peers backup/serve content
- anonymous: but don't trust it to be
- psuedo-anonymous: users can create optional cryptographic identities
- immutable: edits are not supported for anonymous content
- mutable: edits are supported for authenticated content
- PoW-based: **voting is slow/CPU heavy**

### UI Development

    yarn start

notabug ui client will then be available on localhost:3333 talking to notabug.io directly
